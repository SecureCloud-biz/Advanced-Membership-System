Advanced-Membership-System
==========================

A membership system written in PHP.

This was originally on CodeCanyon, but was removed due to the author releasing versions that were not 
operational/had many bugs, as well as being inactive. Hopefully we can breathe some new life into it, as it used to be
a pretty good script.

Built with Bootstrap 3.

==========================

Install:

See the instructions in the read_me file.

N.B. Remember to delete the install directory, if it is left behind after install, the script doesn't work if the install
directory still exists.

The original (V3.5) version of the script pretty much works. There may be a few bugs.
The New (V4) version of the script is full of bugs, and only properly works when SQL Strict mode is off. Any contributions
to help rectify this are greatly appreciated.

This code is by no means perfect, or fully secure, so be careful using it in a production environment.

==========================

Demo:

Will load up a site soon, stand by.

==========================

Extra Notes:

- I know the documentation is poor, it's not mine, will try and improve it at some point, or if anyone else wants to...

- Anyone with insight into security fixes, please fix and commit ;)

- Enjoy!
